# Blockchain-client
A blockchain built using Node js/Go
The blockchain was supposed to reach the commercial stage in collaboration with one of the programming groups, which was canceled.
I decided to make the source public, so that if anyone wanted to use it.

Blockchain-Server-JS source  -> [Blockchain-server-js](https://github.com/Blockchain-Server-JS)

Blockchain-Server-GO source  -> [Blockchain-server-go](https://github.com/Blockchain-Server-GO)
